    <p><b>Question 2</b><br>
        Find if the conditions are obeyed or not?<br>
        You are given two number first as 
        A and second as B and check if both conditions (A<10 and A>B) are satisfied or not with the help of operators.<br>
        Note: You have to complete Is_Valid function. No need to take any input.
    </p>
    <p><b>Ans</b><br><pre>
        const Is_Valid = (A,B) => {
